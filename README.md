# School-of-Health
This is a simple student, employee, department (administrative, academics and operational) database created for a typical Nigerian School of Health offering National Diploma Certificate and Higher National Diploma Certificate.

After completing my National Youth Service (NYSC) were my Place of Primary Assignment (PPA) was a school of health tech. I decided to create what could be a simple hypothetical database for a Nigerian School of Health, with the following major functioning acardemic departments:
- Department of Community Health
- Department of Health Information Management
- Department of Medical Laboratory Tech
- Department of Pharmacy Tech
- Department of Public Health

This database includes tables for;
- Students Bio 
- Students Contact (for guardians/sponsor)
- Students SSCE details (this would hold the grades each student obtained in the respective admission required SSCE subjects)
- Students Medicals (each students basic medical information)
- Employee Bio
- Employee Appointment Info
- Employee Education and Certification
- Employee Contact
- Departments
- Community Health Department
- Health Information Mangement
- Medical Laboratory Tech
- Pharmacy Tech
- Public Health.
